# Tech Blog - CMS-style Blog Site

## Description

Tech Blog is a CMS-style blog site where developers can publish their own blog posts and comment on other developers' posts as well. The application follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
